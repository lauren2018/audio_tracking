Use sound to estimate distance to speaker; 
use accelerometer to count steps and therefore displacement. 
By combining distance and displacement, we can infer the speaker location in 2D.

## Estimate Distance
#######################################
- est_fix_dist_pn.m
- est_fix_dist_since.m
  Given sound (PN sequence/sinc pulse) receiving at the same location, infer: 
  (1) initial tx time, 
  (2) interval between signals, 
  (3) distance between speaker and microphone

  => not enough information for (3)
     d_i = (t_i' - t_b - (i-b)*itvl) * v
     t_b = t_i - (i-b)*itvl - d_i / v

     d_j = (t_j' - (j-b)*itvl) * v - (t_i' - (i-b)*itvl) * v + d_i
         = d_j                     - d_i                     + d_i

     d_i: distance of signal i (initial distance)
     t_i': receiving time of signal i
     t_b: receiving time of reference signal
     itvl: interval between signals
     
     d_j: distance of signal j (we want to estimate dist of signal j)
     t_j': receiving time of signal j

    => Error of initial location d_i is constant for further estimation d_j.

- cal_t1_itvl_pn.m
  Given signal index with known distance to speaker, calculate:
  (1) the reference signal
  (2) the tx time of the reference signal
  (3) the interval of signals

  step 1. For each signal, calculate the number of samples to other signals.
  step 2. Select the most common number of samples from step 1.
  step 3. Select the signal with highest confidence as the reference signal.
          Confidence is defined as number of other signals whose interval the the reference signal is the same as the most common number of samples from step 2.
  step 4. tx time of the reference signal is calculated by: 
            t_b = t_i - (i-b)*itvl - d_i / v
