- preporcess raw accl data to allow matlab to read
  - preprocess_accl_raw.pl

- Analyze walking acceleration pattern:
  - plot_walk_file.m
    i) identify walking patterns, 
    ii) count step
    plot time-series of step (i) and (ii)


  - analyze_step_length.m
    i) identify walking patterns, 
    ii) count step, 
    iii) analyze the step length.
    


challenges
1. random direction movement
    - according to WalkCompass, the gyroscope is not accurate enough
    - even we use WalkCompass
      i) tail error -- 5% data have 45 degree error
      ii) Need to Walk a Few Steps before WalkCompass start to work
