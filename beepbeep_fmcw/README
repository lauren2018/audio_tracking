** About:
*****************************
Here we transmit PN sequence and FMCW chirps together. The goal is to use the peaks (correlation from PN seq, and FFT from FMCW) to help each other to find the best peaks.


*****************************
** Codes:
*****************************
- ofdm_tx_longpn.m
   Generate audio signals
- process_rx_both.m
   Process rx audio signals and combine spikes from PN seq and FMCW to estimate correct peaks.
