1. testPeakDetection.m
    from Mao Wenguang
2. retrieve_signals.m
    preprocess audio signals collected in "beepbeep_fmcw" to extract correlation spikes and ground truth (the correct peaks) which can be applied in machine learning.
3. preprocess_svm_input.m
    preprocess spikes and ground truth (the correct peaks) from retrieve_signals.m to make them of the format for LibSVM.
4. svm_cross_validation.py
    take all preprocessed data from preprocess_svm_input.m and do 10-fold cross-validatation
5. svm_subset_learn.py
    use part of traces to train the model
