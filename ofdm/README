ofdm_rx_itvl.m
    Receive audio generated by Wenguang's code "ofdm_tx" where PN sequence is fixed to 1 ofdm symbol.

ofdm_tx_longpn.m
ofdm_rx_itvl_longpn.m
    "ofdm_tx_longpn" generate audio using large PN sequence
    "ofdm_rx_itvl_longpn" receive audio and calculate intervals

ofdm_rx_itvl_cum.m
    receive audio generated by "ofdm_tx_longpn". Because the audio volume is too small to be identified by individual signal, we accumulate all signals.
